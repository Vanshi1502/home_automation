# HOME_AUTOMATION
This repository contains the code and documentation for a **Home Automation System** developed as part of the IEEE NITK Virtual Expo 2025.
Features
Remote Appliance Control: Switch lights and fans on/off from anywhere using the Blynk mobile app.

Sensor Integration: Monitor room temperature, humidity (DHT11), and light intensity (LDR) for automated or manual control.

Real-Time Feedback: Immediate status updates and control confirmation.

Modular & Scalable: Easily add more devices or sensors as needed.

Secure Access: Uses authentication tokens for safe cloud connectivity.

Manual Override: Appliances can also be controlled using physical switches.

How It Works
1.Hardware Setup:

NodeMCU is wired to relay modules and sensors.

Relays control the AC appliances; sensors provide environmental data.

2.Software & Connectivity:

NodeMCU runs Arduino code that reads sensors and listens for app commands.

Device connects to Wi-Fi and communicates with the Blynk cloud.

Blynk app (on iOS/Android) provides a dashboard for users to control devices and view sensor data.

3.User Interaction:

Users toggle appliances and monitor sensor readings via the app.

Sensor data can trigger automated actions (e.g., turn on fan if temperature is high).
